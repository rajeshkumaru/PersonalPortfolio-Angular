                  I was Rajeshâ€™s immediate supervisor here at CybageSoftware
                  Pvt. Ltd, and have been for four and half years.<br />

                  He has shown himself to be a very intelligent and hardworking
                  young engineer, one who is capable of grasping new concepts
                  very quickly. He has been successful in the performance of all
                  the work entrusted to him. His highly appreciated quality is
                  the commitment he shows in whatever he does.<br />

                  Considering his potential, attitudes, and keenness to learn, I
                  feel that Rajesh is a fit candidate for the organizations he
                  wants to apply for. I strongly endorse his web development
                  skills and wish him success.<br />

                  their different products. Rajesh was always managed to
                  surprise me by achieving task in defined timeline and
                  exceptional quality. He is easy going and target achiever ! I

                  Rajesh is very hard working and puts a lot of efforts in
                  completing tasks assigned to him. He has excellent hold on
                  front end technologies and is able to provide good alternate
                  solutions.<br />
                  He is a quick learner, adaptive and very much proactive in his
                  day to day tasks. He is able to handle client communication
                  effectively. He has a strong understanding of agile processes
                  and follows it meticulously

                  <br />Rajesh would be a valuable asset to any organization he
                  works with. I wish him all the success.

                  Rajesh is one of the finest team player and mentor that I have
                  worked along with. We have worked together as a team under a
                  project for more than 3 years at Cybage and he has all the
                  skills that one could ask for. He has great coding and problem
                  solving abilities along with some very nice interpersonal
                  skills. During the time of continuing team work, I have seen
                  and learned how to pick, execute, track, and complete a whole
                  task by himself as well as in paired development environment.
                  This is by far the best traits that I have experienced and
                  learned from him during his mentoring.<br />

                  Rajesh's talents and his very powerful dedication and
                  determination had made him one of the finest and valuable team
                  player. I am sure he would be an asset to any organization
                  that he joins.

                  I have known Rajesh from the time we joined Cybage back in
                  2015 and worked together in the same project. Rajesh has
                  always been over-delivering in all his tasks. From picking the
                  task, to giving 200% in it, to being the best problem solver.
                  He has done it all.
                  <br />
                  A very quick learner, practitioner, implementer he has been
                  throughout his journey of Software Engineering. Any issue be
                  it of the technology he is working on to the issues that are
                  out of his technical scope, he is very much open to try his
                  hands on the same.
                  <br />
                  Rajesh is a perfect example of being an exemplary coder,
                  critical thinker and an awesome team player. He is super
                  soft-spoken and approachable.
                  <br />
                  There's no second thought on him being the best asset an
                  organisation can have. I wish him all the success in all his
                  endeavors.
